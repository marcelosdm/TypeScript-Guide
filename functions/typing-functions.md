# Functions

## Intro

As said in the [TypeScript Documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/):
> Functions are the fundamental building block of any applications in JavaScript. Theyâ€™re how you build up layers of abstraction, mimicking classes, information hiding, and modules. In TypeScript, while there are classes, namespaces, and modules, functions still play the key role in describing how to do things. TypeScript also adds some new capabilities to the standard JavaScript functions to make them easier to work with.

## Creating a function

As the reference above shows, here we'll see some new capabilities to the functions. We can add types to the parameters and even to the returns. See more bellow.

### Typing

Let's take a look on a basic **TypeScript** function. Here, we're typing the parameter, but as there's no return, its type is set to *void*:

```
function threePointPlay(player: string):void {
	console.log('Three point play by ' + player)
}
```

In the next example, we can see both the **parameter** and the **return** typed:

```
	let foulOut = function(foulsNum:number):boolean {
		return foulsNum > 5
}
```
In the **foulOut** function, we can see that if the arguments is set correctly, the function works:

```
console.log(foulOut(6));
> true
```

But if the arguments is not a *string*, for example, the compiler will throw an error:
```
console.log(foulOut("6"));
```

## Arrow functions

TypeScript allows you to define that a variable will become a function. The following example shows it, with the return set to **void**, that is, there's no return:

```
let mpv:(name:string)=> void;

mpv = name => console.log('The MVP of the season is ' + name + '!');

mpv('King James');

> The MVP of the season is King James
```

If we try to set a number to the **mpv** function (see the example bellow), the compiler will throw an error message saying that *"Argument of type '23' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string"*

```
mpv(23);
```

## Default Parameters

By default, in TypeScript every parameter is required by the function. Let's see an example that is expected two parameters:

```
function sum(n1:number, n2:number):number {
	return n1 + n2
}

sum(2, 3);

// > 5
```

But if we call the function passing **just one parameter**, the compiler will throw an error. See the example:

```
sum(2);

// > Expected 2 arguments, but got 1.

```

## Optional Parameters

But hey! Actually there is a way to set the parameter as an optional one. To do it, we need to add a *?* to the end of the parameter.

```
function buildName(firstName: string, lasName?: string) {
	if (lastName)
		return firstName + ' ' + lastName;
	else
		return firstName;
}

let result1 = buildName('Chico');
// > Chico

let result2 = buildName('Chico', 'Silva');
// > Chico Silva

let result3 = buildName('Chico', 'Silva', 'Mr');
// > Expected 1-2 arguments, but got 3
```

## Rest Parameters

TypeScript allows you to pass multiple values to the last parameter. This way, the compiler will build an array of the arguments passed in. 

First, let's see an example of a function not using the **Rest Parameter**. Note that when calling the function, we need to pass the values as an array:

```
function countPoints(points: number[]): number {
	return points.reduce((a,b) => a + b, 0)
}

countPoints([2, 3, 1]);

// > 6
```

Now, take a look at the same function bellow, but using the **Rest Parameter**, that is, writing the parameter with the ellipsis (**...**). Note that when calling the function, all we need is pass the numbers, not worrying to pass as an array:

```
function countPoints(points: ...number[]): number {
	return points.reduce((a,b) => a + b, 0)
}

countPoints(2, 3, 1);
```
