## Modules

Module is an independent unit which can contain *variables, functions, classes, interfaces*. 

As the [TypeScript Documentation] (http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html) says:
>Modules are executed within their own scope, not in the global scope; this means that variables, functions, classes, etc. declared in a module are not visible outside the module unless they are explicitly exported
